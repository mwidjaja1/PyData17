* introduction [30 minutes]
** slides

** UI tools
 - if you have used the pan / zoom tools or the 'g', 'l', 'k',
   etc keys in mpl, you have used the mpl event framework
   - show demo of keys / pan / zoom
   - the updating coordinates
 - events has always been in mpl (Event class came into codebase on
   Tue Dec 28 2004 as a refactoring of existing functionality


** There is more than a book of material here

Interactive applications using matplotlib by Ben Root

"Learn how Lincoln could use Matplotlib to save the Earth from hordes
of ravenous space ware-rabbits!  Just plotting your data won't save
the world, but turning your plots into interactive applications will
help your users explore their data and gain greater insight into their
problems.  This book will walk the reader through the process of
turning a simple radar viewer into a useful hazardous event tracker,
so you too can spot where the space ware-rabbits are going to strike
next!" - Ben Root

$ source activate mpl_tut

* 00-explore  [5 + 15 minutes]
 - 'hello world' of event processing
 - layers of mpl
   - figure / axes / artist vs canvas distinction
   - figure vs figure manager vs canvas
 - canvas.mpl_connect
 - canvas.mpl_disconnect
 - Three 'classes' of events
   - active
     - ['button_press_event', 'button_release_event', 'scroll_event',
	 'key_press_event', 'key_release_event', 'pick_event']
   - passive
     - ['motion_notify_event', 'figure_enter_event',
       'axes_enter_event', 'axes_leave_event']
   - internal
     - ['draw_event', 'resize_event']
     - important if you are doing blitting (which is it's own tutorial)
 - use OO interface when ever possible

* 01-callable [
 - frequently want to carry state between user interactions
 - simplest way (short of globals) is a callable class
 - going to want to restart IPython after this
   - or `matplolib.rcdefaults()`

** WARNING
 - the callback registry (matplotilb.cbook.CallbackRegistry) only hold
   weakrefs to the callback functions.  If you do not explicitly keep
   a ref to them around they maybe garbage collected.
 - this is probably the biggest gotcha
 - done to prevent reference cycles

* 02-event filtering
 - use an object with several methods, hook them all up to events
 - look at the values in the events to decide what to do
 - hold an artist as state and mutate on user input

* interlude about temperature data
 - data sets from NOAA, historical hourly weather reports
 - only extracting the air temperature, a LOT more information in the reports
 - raw data extraction code in 99-collect_data.py, but processed data
   from BWI in repo
 - ~10 years of ~hourly air temperature readings
#+BEGIN_SRC python
from w_helpers import load_data

bwi = load_data('nyc')

#+END_SRC
 - plot full time series
   - this is sort of useless, but can zoom in!
 - times are in UTC because I lost to timezone normalization while
   prepping for this

* 03-picking
 - look at 2015-01-01 to a few days ago aggregated by day
   - look at bwi_daily columns
 - looking a bit better, but only looking at the mean
   - can see some interesting days
 - 'pick_event' can have arbitrary attributes added by the picker
   - show `set_picker` docstring
 - `set_gid` / `get_gid` a place for users to stash an id, not used my mpl
 - `set_label`/`get_label` are the name used for automatic legend generation

* 04-custom_plotting
 - mpl's 'native' API is low level
 - write the API you need for your data (inside of which you bring
   your data to the API)
 - i-haz-a-soap-box

* 05-interactive_temperature
 - fully functioning 'app'
 - what else could you make it do?

* 99-get data
 - $ conda install -c conda-forge cartopy proj4
 - click on the stations to print station name + template
 - use

* Examples to look at

 - data_browser.py
 - legend_picking.py
 - path_editor.py
 - poly_editor.py
 - viewlims.py
